Size limit on history file

decide rules and syntax for SPACES, pass, adv, reroll ...


add negative numbers in input? ( ex "-1 + 1")


make the case "(0-1)d6" clearer


change display rules for diceroll (2d20 should be more like 2xd20)
    --- 1) automatically build the times node, making 2d20 equivalent to 2xd20  ---- done
    --- 2) have an option in Diceroll to display as a single number??    ----- done

    --- 3) have an option in the Times node to say "5d6" or something
         instead of just the number of times ----- CORRECT POSITION OF 5D6, AND WIDTHS OF TIMES NODE

    
    --- 3b) maybe put it above with a line (see sketch)  ----- NOT DONE

    --- 4) trigger both the options when wanted, ex in 25d6 ----- done

    --- 5) take away the now-useless part of diceroll


fix display bug in case: 3d12 + 2d8 +17 -- done, but make sure tipwidth of cone1 and cone2 isn't fucked up



set variables etc



change something, somewhere, so that the left column in "2x2x2x2" is aligned again

put history file somewhere specific -- ok but sounds sketchy


-------------------

maybe, better error handling (move checks to build_from_splitter in order to give better messages)

fix rng -- done?

fix display bug in case
    (1+1)+(1+1) | x 1 -- ok

fix display bugs with stuff like
    1 x (1+1-(1+1)) -- should be good
    1x(1+1) +1 -- should be good
